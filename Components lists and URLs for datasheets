The National SO website has a similar version of this project, but with parts that we don't have. It is defeintely worth looking at:

The first two items are the range finder and temp sensor that are accurate to 1mm - these will be what is used in the final product.

Ultrasonic Range Finder:
MB1013
HRLV-MaxSonar®-EZ1™
High Performance Ultrasonic Precision Rangefinder

Temperature sensor:
HR-MaxTemp
Temperature Compensation Sensor for the HR series of sensors
http://www.maxbotix.com/documents/HR-MaxTemp_Datasheet.pdf

These components can be paired connected with shielded cable (for noise reduction).
An arduino or other microcontroller can also be used to control and connect this device to a computer so that the results can be stored and displayed.
A whole rig would need to be built to be able to adjust the temp. sensor vs. the drop hight because it needs to be half way between the sensor and the drop hight. 


A more common/ less accurate range finder can be used to practice generating data from an arduino and recording/displaying that data:

The Ping))) sensor from Parallax.com (rev B) is already at the school and able to be tested.
